## Challenge Overview
##### Overview of Election Audit
I assited Tom, an Colorado Elections Board employee, in an election audit of the tabulated results for U.S. Congressional precint in Colorado. It was requested that I report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. 

Python was chosen to be used so that the process could be automated and be modified to use in other elections by the Colorado Board of Elections. 

## Challenge Summary
##### Election-Audit Summary
The code for this audit was written with refactoring options in mind for the future. It can be modified to be used in any election for the Colorado Board of Elections. For example, the code could be modified to identify the winner by county. This would allow the board to audit for inconsistities. Additionally, the code could be modified to allow the board to analyze the data for presidential elections. With additional data in the data set, they could track party affiliations, county alignment, and voting trends.
